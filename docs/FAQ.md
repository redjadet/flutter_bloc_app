# ❓ FAQ

## 📌 What is this repository for?

This is a reference Flutter application that demonstrates clean architecture, offline-first data access, and production-minded tooling. It is intended for technical evaluation and as a starting point for new features, not as a turnkey product.

## 👥 Who should review this codebase?

- Developers looking for architecture and testing patterns
- Teams that want an offline-first template with BLoC/Cubit

## 🔍 What should I review first?

Start with these entry points:

- `lib/app.dart` and `lib/main.dart`
- `lib/core/di/` (dependency injection)
- `lib/app/router/` (navigation)
- `lib/features/counter/` (core example feature)
- `lib/shared/` (cross-cutting utilities)

## 🧭 Why BLoC/Cubit over Riverpod or Provider?

This codebase emphasizes explicit state transitions, testable business logic, and predictable rebuilds. Cubits keep UI lean and enable focused unit/bloc tests without widget pumps.

See [State Management Choice](state_management_choice.md) for the full rationale.

## 🚀 How do I run the app?

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

For platform setup and configuration, see [Developer Guide](new_developer_guide.md) and [Security & Secrets](security_and_secrets.md).

## 🔐 Which features need API keys or services?

- Firebase (Auth, Remote Config, etc.)
- Google Maps (Android/iOS keys)
- Hugging Face Inference API

See [Security & Secrets](security_and_secrets.md) for setup details.

## 📱 Are there platform-specific dependencies?

Yes. Some packages only work on certain platforms:

- **`apple_maps_flutter`** – iOS-only; app uses `google_maps_flutter` on Android
- **`window_manager`** – Desktop-only; no-op on mobile
- **`local_auth`** – Both platforms; uses fingerprint on Android, Face ID/Touch ID on iOS

The app handles this automatically (e.g., maps switch based on platform). See [Tech Stack](tech_stack.md#platform-specific-dependencies) for the full list.

## ✅ How is testing handled?

The project uses unit, bloc, widget, and golden tests. Common pitfalls are captured in `test/shared/common_bugs_prevention_test.dart`.

See [Testing Overview](testing_overview.md) for details.

## 📱 How do I keep UI responsive and adaptive?

Use the shared responsive extensions and platform-adaptive widgets instead of raw Material buttons or hard-coded spacing. The base layout components handle safe areas and keyboard insets.

See [UI/UX Guidelines](ui_ux_responsive_review.md).
